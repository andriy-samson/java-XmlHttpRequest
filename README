This code provides a pure Java implementation of the W3C's XmlHttpRequest API.

It can be used in any java program, or can be dropped into a processing sketch
to allow writing portable code that works the same in the java and javascript
runtimes. It may possibly even work on android...(?)

The code was written by Richard Bair and described in his article:

   "XmlHttpRequest and Swing"
   http://weblogs.java.net/blog/rbair/archive/2006/08/xmlhttprequest.html

I simply extracted the smallest subset of classes needed to compile
org.jdesktop.http.async.XmlHttpRequest.

The full code is in the SwingX-WS subversion repository, which is here:
